App "photoback client"

Bundle ID at.yeoman.photobackup

The app collects metadata about photos locally on the device itself.

When a [photobackup server](https://github.com/sbohmann/photobackup-server) instance is configured by the user in settings and a backup is started, photos, videos, and other files, as well as metadata, are transferred to and stored on that same server.

It is entirely at the user's disgression to set up or choose such an instance.

The app never transfers information to the app's creator.

There is no backend involved.

All communication is limited to photobackup server instances of the user's choice, or any other compatible or partially compatible end point chosen by the user instead.
